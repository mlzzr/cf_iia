	<h3>Overview:</h3>

<p>

	This study has 2 parts. At the end of the study, the computer will randomly select one part. Then, within that part, the computer will randomly select one question. Your payment will depend on your answer to that question!
</p>

<p>
	Therefore, <b>you should treat each question in each part as if it was the one that counts and determines your payment for the entire study</b> - because it may very well be!
	The study ends with a very short survey that you also need to complete to be paid any bonus payments.
</p>


	<h3>Part 1</h3>

    <p>Part 1 takes about {{Constants.minutes1}} minutes and consists of a number of rounds. In each round, there are two boxes filled with colorful balls. Each of the two boxes contains the same number of balls, but their color compositions are different. For example, Box A could contain 1 <span style="color:blue"><b>blue</b></span> ball, 3 <span style="color:green"><b>green</b></span> balls and 8 <span style="color:black"><b>black</b></span> balls, and Box B could contain 3 <span style="color:blue"><b>blue</b></span> balls, 1 <span style="color:green"><b>green</b></span> ball and 8 <span style="color:black"><b>black</b></span> balls. The composition of the boxes may change from round to round. </p>

<p>At the beginning of each round, the computer will select either Box A or Box B by tossing a fair coin. <b>Hence, each of the two boxes has 50% chance of being selected.</b> </p>

<p> We will <b>not</b> tell you which box was actually selected by the computer, but you will get a piece of information: by clicking the button <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-large">{{Constants.button_label}}</button>, the computer will randomly draw a ball from the selected box and show it to you. <b>Each ball in the box is equally likely to be drawn.</b> After the computer draws a ball, you may see the following message:</p>

<!--<img src="{% static ball_image %}" width="600" class="box2"/>-->

<!--<p> We will <b>not</b> tell you which box was actually selected by the computer, but you will get a piece of information: the computer will randomly draw a ball from the selected box and show it to you. <b>Each ball in the box is equally likely to be drawn.</b> After the computer draws a ball, you may see the following message:</p>-->

<img src="{% static ball_image %}" width="350" class="box2" />


<p>Now, your job is to answer the following question.</p>

<img src="{% static update_question %}" width="700" class="box2"/>

<br>

<p><em> <b> Some help in understanding the question: </b> </em>You might find it helpful to think about the question in the following way. Imagine that in each round, instead of selecting a box and drawing a ball only once, the computer repeats what it does many times. That is, given two boxes, the computer tosses a coin, selects a box, draws a ball from it (and puts it back), and with the two boxes staying the same, it tosses a coin again, selects a box again, draws a ball again... During the whole process of repetition, there may be multiple instances where you see a <span style="color:blue"><b>blue</b></span> ball being drawn. <b>Among such instances</b>, what do you think is the proportion of times when the <span style="color:blue"><b>blue</b></span> ball was actually drawn from Box A? This proportion should be your answer to the original question.</p>

<p>If a question is selected by the computer for payment, then whether you will get your extra bonus of {{Constants.high_bonus}} depends on your answer to that question. Our payment rule makes sure that <b>you are most likely to get the extra bonus when you give us your best guess</b>. Think carefully and then type in the number that truly reflects your assessment. You should not rush the questions or randomly answer something, as this will increase the chance of you not getting the extra bonus! If you would like to know the details of the payment rule, read the next screen. We will <b>not</b> quiz you on the information on the next screen. </p>


<!--DON'T SAY PROBABILITY. SAY "what do you think are the odds that the picked box is Box A?"-->

<!--USE FREQUENCY FRAME TO HELP SUBJECTS THINK ABOUT ODDS. "suppose the computer select boxes many times. among the cases where the ball picked is blue, what's the proportion of cases where the selected box is actually Box A?"-->


<p>
	We urge you to be <b>truthful</b> and <b> thoughtful </b> in answering the questions because <b>our research's quality depends on it!</b>
</p>


	<h3>Part 2</h3>

<p>

	Part 2 of the study takes about {{Constants.minutes2}} minutes. In this part, you will be asked to make predictions about some events. Further instructions will follow after the first part of the study.


	<h3>Survey</h3>

<p>

	At the very end of the survey, we will ask you a few demographic questions. We thank you for answering these questions carefully and truthfully. You will need to complete the survey in order to be paid any bonus. You will still be eligible for bonus payment even if you choose the option "I prefer not to answer" for some or all the questions.
