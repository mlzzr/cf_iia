    <p>
       The computer chose {% if bonus_part == 2 %}Question {{bonus_guess}} in {% else %}{% endif %}Round {{bonus_round}}, Part {{bonus_part}} to count for payment.
        <!--Your answer to that question was {{ selected_guess }}%.-->
    </p>

    <p>
        {% if bonus > 0 %} Congratulations! You win the extra bonus! Your total earning will be the HIT payment {{ Constants.base_pay }} plus the completion bonus {{ Constants.complete_bonus }} and an extra bonus of {{ bonus }} for a total of {{Constants.total_max}}. Congratulations!
        {% else %} Unfortunately, you were unlucky and didn't win the extra bonus. Your total earning will be the HIT payment {{ Constants.base_pay }} plus the completion bonus {{ Constants.complete_bonus }} for a total of {{Constants.total_min}}.
        {% endif %}
