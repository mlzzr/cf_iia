	<h3>Overview:</h3>

<p>
This task asks you to choose between an investment and a lottery. You will receive the bonus of {{Constants.high_bonus}} if your choice pays out and no bonus otherwise. The study ends with a very short survey that you also need to complete to be paid any bonus payments.
</p>


	<h3>Task description:</h3>

<p>There are 100 investment opportunities. We <b>randomly</b> pick one investment opportunity and offer it to you <b>for free</b>. <b>Out of the 100 investments there are {{prior_g}} good ones.</b> Suppose you take the investment, you will receive the bonus of {{Constants.high_bonus}} if the investment is good and no bonus if the investment is bad.

<p>Before you decide whether to take the investment opportunity, we will also assign a consultant to help you inspect its quality. After the inspection, the consultant will report to you whether he thinks the investment is good or bad. <b>The consultant is either Bob or Mike.</b> Both Bob and Mike may make mistakes, but Bob makes mistakes less often. The table below summarizes how a consultant will report under each scenario.</p>

<table class="tg">
  <tr>
    <th class="tg-baqh">Investment quality</th>
    <th class="tg-baqh">Good ({{prior_g}} out of 100 times)</th>
    <th class="tg-baqh">Bad ({{prior_b}} out of 100 times)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-s6z2" rowspan="2">Bob's report</td>
    <td class="tg-baqh">{{high_acc}}% of the times: "The investment is Good."</td>
    <td class="tg-baqh">{{high_acc}}% of the times: "The investment is Bad."</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">{{high_err}}% of the times: "The investment is Bad."</td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">{{high_err}}% of the times: "The investment is Good."</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-s6z2" rowspan="2">Mike's report</td>
    <td class="tg-baqh">{{low_acc}}% of the times: "The investment is Good."</td>
    <td class="tg-baqh">{{low_acc}}% of the times: "The investment is Bad."</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">{{low_err}}% of the times: "The investment is Bad."</td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">{{low_err}}% of the times: "The investment is Good."</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>To understand this table, let's take the two cells corresponding to "Good ({{prior_g}} out of 100 times)" and "Bob's report" as an example. These two cells say that <b>if the investment is indeed good</b>, then Bob will say "The investment is Good" {{high_acc}}% of the times, but will mistakenly say "The investment is Bad" {{high_err}}% of the times. The other cells should be interpreted similarly.</p>

<p>After the consultant makes his report, you will have to make a decision. <b>You can either take the investment opportunity, or you can take a lottery that gives you the bonus of {{Constants.high_bonus}} with a certain chance and no bonus otherwise.</b> After you make your decision, we will reveal the quality of the investment as well as the result of the lottery and you will be paid accordingly.</p>
