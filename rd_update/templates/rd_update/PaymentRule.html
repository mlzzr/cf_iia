
<p>If you are curious about the details of the payment rule, read the box below. We will <b>not</b> quiz you on the information in the box. </p>

<div class="box2">
<h4>Payment rule</h4>
   <p> At the beginning of the study, the computer has randomly generated a number <b>X</b> between 0 and 100. After you tell us how likely you think the investment is good, say it's <b>Y%</b>, we will compare <b>X</b> and <b>Y</b>.
    <ul>
        <li>If <b>X>Y</b>, then you will win the bonus of {{ Constants.high_bonus }} with <b>X%</b> chance.</li>
        <li>If <b>Y>X</b>, then you will win the bonus of {{ Constants.high_bonus }} if the investment you evaluate is indeed good.</li>
    </ul>
In short, you win {{ Constants.high_bonus }} either with <b>X%</b> chance or when the investment is good, whichever you think is more likely.</p>

    <p>(In the end, we will tell you the quality of the investment as well as X.) </p>

<p>Why does this (complicated!) rule ensure that you should tell us your true assessment? Imagine you believed that there was a 60% chance that the investment was good. But instead of typing in 60%, you say it's 80%. What happens next?

<ul>
	<li> Imagine the number X generated by the computer is 70.  </li>
	<li> Then, since 70 is smaller than 80, the computer will pay you if and only if the investment was good. </li>
</ul>

This is, of course, a bad deal for you because you now only win with 60% chance according to your true assessment. Had you told us your true assessment and typed in 60%, you would have won with 70% chance! </p>
