	<h3>Overview:</h3>

<p>
	<b>In this task, you will be asked to make several choices between an "investment" or a lottery.</b> You will receive the bonus of <b>{{Constants.high_bonus}}</b> if a randomly selected choice of yours pays out and <b>no bonus</b> otherwise. The study ends with a very short survey that you also need to complete to be paid any bonus payments.
</p>

<!--<p>After the consultant makes his report, you will have to make a decision. <b>You can either take the investment opportunity, or you can take a lottery that gives you the bonus of {{Constants.high_bonus}} with a certain chance and no bonus otherwise.</b> After you make your decision, we will reveal the quality of the investment as well as the result of the lottery and you will be paid accordingly.</p>-->

    <p>After the consultant makes his report, you will be asked to make several comparisons. In each comparison, you will answer whether you prefer to take the investment opportunity or a lottery that pays out <b>{{Constants.high_bonus}}</b> with a certain chance and <b>{{ Constants.low_bonus }}</b> otherwise. (Both the investment opportunity and the lottery are free.)</p>

    <p>Then, the computer will randomly select a comparison. (You answers will <b>not</b> affect which comparison the computer selects and every comparison is possible to be selected.) <b>We will give you your preferred option in the selected comparison. </b> </p>

    <p>Hence, maximizing your chance of receiving the {{ Constants.high_bonus }} bonus is very simple: <b>given your information, if you think that the investment's chance of being good is higher than the pay-out chance of the right-hand side lottery in the comparison, you should click Left; otherwise you should click Right.</b></p>

<p>In the end, we will tell you the quality of the investment as well as the outcome of the lottery in the selected comparison. Your bonus will be determined accordingly.</p>
