	<h3>Task description:</h3>

<p>There are 100 investment opportunities. We <b>randomly</b> pick one investment opportunity and offer it to you <b>for free</b>. <b>Out of the 100 investments there are {{prior_g}} good ones.</b> Suppose you take the investment, you will receive the bonus of <b>{{Constants.high_bonus}}</b> if the investment is good and <b>no bonus</b> if the investment is bad.

<p>Before you decide whether to take the investment opportunity, we will also assign a consultant to help you inspect its quality. After the inspection, the consultant will report to you whether he thinks the investment is good or bad.
    {% if high_acc == low_acc %} The consultant, who's name is {{ player.junior_name }}, sometimes makes mistakes.
    {% else %}
        The consultant will either be {{ player.senior_name }} or {{ player.junior_name }}. Both {{ player.senior_name }} and {{ player.junior_name }} sometimes make mistakes.
    {% endif %}
    The list below enumerates how a consultant will report under each scenario.</p>

    <p>If the investment is indeed <b>good</b> (which happens {{prior_g}} out of 100 times), then</p>
    <ul>
      {% if high_acc != low_acc %}
      <li>{{ player.senior_name }} will report {{Constants.good_message}} {{high_acc}}% of the times, but will mistakenly report {{Constants.bad_message}} {{high_err}}% of the times;
      </li>
      {% endif %}
      <li>{{ player.junior_name }} will report {{Constants.good_message}} {{low_acc}}% of the times, but will mistakenly report {{Constants.bad_message}} {{low_err}}% of the times.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>If the investment is indeed <b>bad</b> (which happens {{prior_b}} out of 100 times), then</p>
    <ul>
      {% if high_acc != low_acc %}
      <li>{{ player.senior_name }} will report {{Constants.bad_message}} {{high_acc}}% of the times, but will mistakenly report {{Constants.good_message}} {{high_err}}% of the times;
      </li>
      {% endif %}
      <li>{{ player.junior_name }} will report {{Constants.bad_message}} {{low_acc}}% of the times, but will mistakenly report {{Constants.good_message}} {{low_err}}% of the times.
      </li>
    </ul>
