Details on the Payment Rule -- Skip if you are not interested to know!

<div class="box1">
<p>
	This page goes into details on how we ensure that you are mostly likely to win the extra bonus when you give us your best guess. <b>You will NOT be quizzed on this information. </b> We only provide this information in case you are interested in knowing how to construct what economists call "incentive compatible elicitation mechanisms"! You can also <a href="javascript:window.print()">print this page</a>.
</p> 
</div>

<p>
	The payment rule for this part is as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Suppose the computer has chosen a question to count for payment and in answering this question, you say it is X% likely that the computer will select Box A and draw a blue ball from it. </li>
<li> Then the computer randomly generates a number Y between 0 and 100. The value of Y is not related to any of your answers.  </li>
<li> We then compare X and Y. </li>
	<ul>
		<li>If X is larger than Y, then you receive the extra bonus of {{Constants.high_bonus}} if the computer indeed selected Box A and drew a blue ball from it and no extra bonus if it was not the case.</li>
		<li>If Y is larger than X, then you receive the extra bonus of {{Constants.high_bonus}} with Y% chance and no bonus with (100-Y)% chance. This is done by letting the computer generate a second random number Z between 0 and 100, and you get paid the extra bonus if and only if Z is smaller than Y.</li>
	</ul>
<li>In short, you will receive the extra bonus either when the computer indeed selected Box A and drew a blue ball from it, or when you win a Y%-chance lottery, whichever you think is more likely to happen.</li>
</ul>
    
Why does this (complicated!) rule ensure that you should tell us your true assessment? Imagine you believed that it was 30% likely that the computer selected Box A and drew a blue ball from it. But instead of typing in 30%, you say it's 40%. What happens next?

<ul>
	<li> Imagine the number Y generated by the computer is 35.  </li>
	<li> Then, since 35 is smaller than 40, the computer will pay you if and only if the computer indeed selected Box A and drew a blue ball from it. </li>
</ul>

<p> This is, of course, a bad deal for you because you now only win with probability 30% according to your true assessment. Had you told us your true assessment and typed in 30%, the computer would have paid you according to the outcome of a 35%-chance lottery! </p>
